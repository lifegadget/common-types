 * **LambdaEventParser**
 *
 * Ensures that the _typed_ `request` is separated from a possible Proxy Integration
 * Request that would have originated from API Gateway; also returns the `apiGateway`
 * payload with the "body" removed (as it would be redundant to the request).
 *
 * Typical usage is:
 *
```typescript
const { request, apiGateway } = LambdaEventParser.parse(event);
```
 *
 * this signature is intended to mimic the `LambdaSequence.from(event)` API but
 * without the parsing of a `sequence` property being extracted.
